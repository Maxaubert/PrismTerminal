/**
 * THE DIAGNOSTICS LOG'S WRITER (#140; owner, 2026-10-07: "implement some
 * robust logging and debugging into the program especially to catch stalls").
 * For both hosts; spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-diagnostics-log-design.md`,
 * schema `docs/diagnostics.md`.
 *
 * `<userData>\logs\diag.jsonl`, one JSON object per line. Appends are batched
 * every 250 ms through one queue, so a burst of lines is one write and the
 * order is the order they were said in. At 2 MB the file rotates to `.1`
 * through `.4`, so an app holds at most 10 MB. At quit the queue is written
 * SYNCHRONOUSLY (`flushSync`), so the line just before a crash lands.
 *
 * A LOGGER THAT FAILS IS SILENT. A write never throws into its caller: the
 * first failure queues one `logger-error` line (which lands if the next write
 * works, as after a moment's file lock) and the rest are dropped quietly.
 * Nothing here may take the app down to report that the app is slow.
 *
 * A ROTATION THAT FAILS DOES NOT STOP THE LOG (review of #140). Renaming the
 * full file fails with EBUSY or EPERM while something holds it open without
 * share-delete (an editor, `Get-Content -Wait`, an antivirus scan). The batch
 * is then appended to the live file anyway and the rotation is tried again
 * 30 s later: before, every flush retried, failed and dropped its lines, the
 * `logger-error` line with them, and the log went quiet for the session.
