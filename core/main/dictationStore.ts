 * The dictation models and the NVIDIA engine pack on disk (#13), in the one
 * folder Prism and Prism Terminal share (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\PrismDictation`; the
 * host passes it in as `root`, and the tests pass a temp folder).
 *
 *   <root>/models/<id>.bin                 a model
 *   <root>/engines/<id>-<sha256[0..12]>/   the GPU pack, unzipped
 *
 * THE ONE PROMISE this file makes: nothing unverified is ever loaded or run. A
 * download streams into `<final>.part` while it is hashed and counted, and only
 * a file whose byte count AND sha256 both match the catalog is renamed into
 * place. So a file under its final name was verified by construction, and the
 * cheap question asked afterwards (is it there, is it the catalogued size) is
 * enough to call it installed without hashing 2.9 GB on every look.
 *
 * The pack is a zip, so "in place" takes three more steps: the verified zip is
 * unzipped into its folder, the zip is deleted, and a small marker file is
 * written LAST. A folder without its marker is a crash half way through an
 * unzip and never reads as installed. The folder carries the hash in its name
 * so a pack the catalog has moved on from can never be mistaken for the new one.
 *
 * Nothing here retries: a failure is reported with its reason and the row in
 * the model manager offers Retry. Redirects are fetch's own business (the
 * model host answers every download with one).
