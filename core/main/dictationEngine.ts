/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * The resident whisper-server (#13), main side.
 *
 * WHY A SERVER AND NOT A RUN PER CLIP. Loading the model is the slow part
 * and the pass is the fast one. MEASURED 2026-09-19 on the owner's PC: a
 * resident server answers a Base pass on CPU in about 0.9 s whatever the
 * clip's length (2 s to 11 s), and Large-v3 on the NVIDIA pack in 0.36 to
 * 0.50 s, where a fresh process pays the model load every time and, on the
 * GPU, a 9.1 s kernel compile on its first run. Live text once a second is
 * only possible because the process stays up between passes.
 *
 * WHAT THE REAL SERVER SPEAKS (release b5130, measured the same day): it is
 * started as `whisper-server.exe -m <model> --host 127.0.0.1 --port <n>
 * -l <language or auto>`, it is ready when GET / answers, and a pass is a
 * POST /inference of multipart form-data with the wav as `file` and
 * `response_format=json`; the answer is `{ "text": "..." }`.
 *
 * The audio is never written to disk: it arrives as bytes over IPC and
 * leaves as bytes over a loopback socket to a port nobody else was told.
 *
 * PARAKEET IS ONE PROCESS PER PASS (#121). The pinned release has no server
 * for it, only parakeet-cli, and none is needed: MEASURED on the owner's PC,
 * a fresh process loads Parakeet v3 (q8_0) and answers the 11 s clip in 0.73
 * to 0.86 s on the CPU and 0.76 to 0.78 s on the GPU pack, under the time a
 * resident Whisper Base takes. It is started as `parakeet-cli.exe -m <model>
 * -f - -np -t <n>` (plus `-ng` on the CPU engine), the WAV goes in on STDIN
 * (its `-f -`, read into memory, MEASURED: "read 352078 bytes from stdin"),
 * and the text comes back on stdout. So this path writes no audio to disk
 * either. It has no language switch: the model detects the language itself.
