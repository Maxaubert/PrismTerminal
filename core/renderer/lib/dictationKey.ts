/**
 * The dictation hotkey (#13): which key events start, stop and cancel a
 * recording. A pure reducer, because the hard part of this key cannot be tried
 * by machine (AltGr on a physical Norwegian keyboard is on the owner's hands-on
 * list) and so every rule has to be provable from a written sequence of events.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A PLAIN KEYDOWN. The default key is Right Alt, and on Norwegian
 * and most European layouts Right Alt is AltGr, the key that types @ { } [ ] \ | ~.
 * Windows reports AltGr as ControlLeft DOWN immediately followed by AltRight
 * DOWN, so the AltRight event arrives carrying ctrl AND alt, and the user then
 * presses Digit2 for an @. A hotkey that fired on the down would start a
 * recording every time somebody typed an e-mail address. So a BARE MODIFIER is
 * read as a SOLO HOLD (hold mode) or a SOLO TAP (toggle mode): the key alone,
 * with nothing else pressed while it decides. A chord or a plain key (Ctrl+Shift+D,
 * F9) has no such ambiguity and acts on its down.
 *
 * The reducer keeps no clock of its own: every event carries `at`, and the host
 * sends a 'tick' when the hold time is up (one setTimeout at holdMs is enough).
