// WHAT THE TERMINAL ANSWERS A PROGRAM THAT ASKS (#168, #172, #171). Pure: the panel
// registers the parser handlers and writes these through `term.input(reply,
// false)`, the path xterm's own replies take. Rule `replies-only-when-asked`
// (docs/regression-rules.md): every byte here answers a query in the pty's own
// stream, or is the `?997` report the program switched on with `?2031h`, and
// none holds CR, LF or anything a shell would run.
//
// MEASURED (Claude Code 2.1.296, bundled ConPTY, 2026-10-10): xterm answered
// `ESC]11;?` from the CLEAR canvas the panel paints behind (rule 14) as
// `rgb:0000/0000/0000`, so Claude's "auto" theme picked dark on every ground.
// Claude asks OSC 11 only (never OSC 10, never `?996n`), writes `?2031h`
// without a DECRQM probe first, and on a pushed `?997;2n` asks OSC 11 again and
// switches: its debug log went from "detected=dark" to "detected=light".
