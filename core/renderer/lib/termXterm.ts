/**
 * The theme as handed to xterm. Pure, so what xterm gets is tested.
 *
 * EVERY VALUE IS `#rrggbb` OR `#rrggbbaa` (#112). xterm 6 parses those and
 * comma `rgba()` only; space syntax and `hsla()` go to a canvas path that
 * throws on anything not opaque. A colour with an alpha now reaches here (a
 * Custom selection, a host style's `rgba()` ground), so each is put in the
 * one stored form on the way out.
 *
 * THE PANEL PAINTS THE GROUND, NOT XTERM (2026-09-19, owner screenshot: a grey
 * bar along the bottom of a black terminal). xterm sizes itself in whole rows,
 * MEASURED at 604px in a 611px box, so a few pixels under the last row are
 * never xterm's to paint. While the canvas carried the ground and the box
 * around it was transparent, that strip showed the native window background
 * instead of the theme. So where the panel paints the ground (`paintsGround`)
 * the canvas is clear: every pixel of the panel gets exactly ONE coat, and two
 * translucent coats would be a visibly darker panel on an acrylic window.
 * Where the host paints behind the panel (Prism's dock) the canvas carries
 * the ground, clear only when asked (`clearGround`: following an acrylic
 * style, so the window's material shows through).
 *
 * The block cursor draws the character under it in `cursorAccent`, which
 * defaults to the background; on a clear background that would be a hole, so
 * it is named.
