/**
 * WHEN A RESUMING TAB SHOWS ITS TERMINAL (#106; spec
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-launch-skeleton-design.md). A tab coming
 * back to Claude or Codex wears a skeleton of the agent's layout until the
 * agent has drawn itself, and the shell's own words (its prompt, the resume
 * command) are cleared before the agent draws a cell, so they are never seen.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-30, pwsh starting `claude` as its startup command through
 * the bundled ConPTY: the first console title is exactly `claude` (3.6 s),
 * preceded only by terminal setup; then Claude's own `✳ Claude Code` (5.4 s),
 * and the switch to the alternate screen 35 ms after it.
 *
 * So: CLEAR just before the title that names the agent; REVEAL once the agent
 * has painted, which is the next title that differs from its bare name, or a
 * switch to the alternate screen, each given a moment to land; or at once on
 * a key (the user sees what they type), an exit or a failed spawn; or at a
 * ceiling, whatever is there. Pure: the panel feeds it and keeps the clock.
