/**
 * WHICH MARK A TAB WEARS (#143; spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-
 * indicator-styles-design.md`, section 3, reworked by `2026-10-10-full-style-
 * rework-design.md`). Pure: the indicator style, the tab style, the tab's
 * state and whether it is in front go in; WHAT to draw, in WHICH colour role,
 * with WHICH motion comes out. Every rule of the owner's decisions lives here,
 * so a strip only draws what it is told.
 *
 * - Minimal: working is the running bar (flat) or the growing arrow edge
 *   (Prompt); finished, question and failed are a 3 px line (flat) or the whole
 *   edge (Prompt) in their colour.
 * - Ring: the spinner beside the name while working; everything else Minimal's.
 * - Full: a tab NOT in front is filled edge to edge in its state colour. Working
 *   on a flat tab carries Minimal's run on top (`overlay`); a working Powerline
 *   segment is the fill alone, its edge still (owner, 2026-10-10: the pulsing
 *   arrow belongs to the tab you are on). Finished is the icon's rainbow, solid,
 *   flowing (owner, 2026-10-10, choice 1A). The tab in front is never filled
 *   and shows Minimal's mark, so it stays obvious in every state.
 * - Off: no working mark; the attention marks as Minimal.
 * - Question breathes everywhere, failed is still, finished flows the rainbow
 *   (or stands still in the finished colour with the rainbow off).
