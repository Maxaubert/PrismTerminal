/**
 * EVERY COLOUR A STRIP'S MARKS WEAR (#143), worked out once from what the
 * window paints. Pure, so both apps' strips colour the marks the same way.
 *
 * - The LINE colours (a run, a line, a Prompt edge) are the agent colours
 *   (`useAgentColors`), made opaque on the solid ground and held to 3:1 on
 *   every ground the mark can sit on. Where they already clear it nothing moves.
 * - The rainbow is the icon's seven, floored the same way, as a looping
 *   gradient along a line and down an edge.
 * - The FILL colours are Full's: SOLID (owner, 2026-10-10), so a see-through
 *   working colour (#112) is laid on the ground first, and NOT floored: the
 *   fill is the state's own colour. Finished with the rainbow on is the icon's
 *   seven, raw, across the whole tab (the rework's choice 1A).
 * - The name INK on each fill follows the owner's rule (`nameInk`), once per
 *   state colour; on the rainbow, once from its worst colour (`rainbowInk`).
 * - The OVERLAY is Minimal's working mark on a working fill. Classic's run is
 *   the NAME'S ink (owner, 2026-10-10: "if the tab is yellow ... the working bar
 *   that is on that tab, like the minimal bar, should be black and not like a
 *   faded arc yellow"). Prompt's edge sits in the ground-coloured gap, where
 *   black would vanish on a dark theme, so it is a shade of the working colour
 *   clearing 3:1 on the fill and the ground (`shadeOn`, variant 2A).
