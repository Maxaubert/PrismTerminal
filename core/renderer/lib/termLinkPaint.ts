/**
 * Paints the links in a terminal's buffer (owner, 2026-09-19). xterm's link
 * addon only underlines a link while the pointer is on it, so a printed URL
 * looked like any other text. A DECORATION is what colours cells that are
 * already in the buffer: one per row a link sits on, carrying the link colour
 * as its foreground and a faint underline as its element.
 *
 * WHAT IS SCANNED, and it is the whole design. Scrollback is immutable: a line
 * that has left the live screen never changes again, so its links are painted
 * once and kept (a marker rides each one, and xterm disposes it when the line
 * is trimmed). The LIVE screen is not: a TUI redraws its rows in place, and a
 * decoration left on a row whose text has changed is a blue smear over words
 * that were never a link. So every pass throws away what it painted from the
 * last finished line down and paints that part again. A marker remembers where
 * "finished" was, which survives the buffer scrolling and trimming under it.
 *
 * Not on the alternate screen: vim and less own every cell there, markers do
 * not exist in it, and what is in it is not a log of printed output.
