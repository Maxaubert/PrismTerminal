/**
 * Paints the links in a terminal's buffer (owner, 2026-09-19). xterm's link
 * addon only underlines a link while the pointer is on it, so a printed URL
 * looked like any other text. A DECORATION is what colours cells that are
 * already in the buffer: one per row a link sits on, carrying the link colour
 * as its foreground and a faint underline as its element.
 *
 * WHAT IS SCANNED, and it is the whole design. Scrollback is immutable: a line
 * that has left the live screen never changes again, so its links are painted
 * once and kept (a marker rides each one, and xterm disposes it when the line
 * is trimmed). The LIVE screen is not: a TUI redraws its rows in place, and a
 * decoration left on a row whose text has changed is a blue smear over words
 * that were never a link. So every pass throws away what it painted from the
 * last finished line down and paints that part again. A marker remembers where
 * "finished" was, which survives the buffer scrolling and trimming under it.
 *
 * NO PASS HOLDS THE PAGE (#167). A full pass (a resize, a theme, a buffer
 * switch) paints the live screen at once and the scrollback after it, bottom
 * up, in slices of SLICE_MS (`linkScanPlan.ts`); a found path repaints only
 * the lines that asked about it (`revisit`). Before, both walked all 10,000
 * lines of scrollback in one task, in every tab: 2 s window stalls, MEASURED.
 *
 * THE ALTERNATE SCREEN IS INKED AS IT IS DRAWN (owner, 2026-09-28: a link in
 * Claude Code's fullscreen view "is not blue ... it seems to know it's a link
 * since i can click it"). Markers do not exist there, so neither do
 * decorations. Instead, each time xterm draws rows there (`onRender`), the
 * link text in those rows' elements is wrapped in a span of the link colour.
 * xterm's DOM renderer REPLACES a row's contents when it draws it, so a row a
 * TUI rewrites starts clean and is inked again only if it still holds a link:
 * no smear to clean up. Per row: a program that owns the screen places its own
 * text, and a link it breaks over two rows is two pieces of text there.
