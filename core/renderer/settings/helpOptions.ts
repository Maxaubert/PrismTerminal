 * EVERY COMMAND-HELP OPTION, BY ID (#12): the same deal `options.ts` makes for
 * the terminal's and `dictationOptions.ts` for dictation's. The row renders as
 * `data-pref="<id>"`, and each app's e2e asserts that its page shows this list.
 *
 * A list of its own, of one, rather than a row in `TERMINAL_OPTIONS`: Prism's
 * terminal parity check reads THAT file as text, so a row added there would
 * turn Prism's gate red until Prism had wired the panel. A host that has not
 * wired it simply does not read this file yet.
