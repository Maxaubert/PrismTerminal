/**
 * The window the update chip opens (#28). Owner, 2026-09-19: "when you click
 * the Update badge, it opens like a pop window, which shows the change log or
 * like patch notes for the new update, and then you can choose cancel or
 * install." One copy, for both apps.
 *
 * Props only, like the chip. It closes on Cancel, on Escape and on a press
 * outside it. Whether Install may start at once is the HOST's question (it ends
 * in the app quitting, and a working agent or unsaved text has a say), so this
 * only reports the choice.
 *
 * IT STAYS FOR THE INSTALL, AND DRAWS THE BAR (#32). Owner, 2026-09-20: "when
 * you click install keep me with the panel open and have the progress bar
 * straight there, kind of like the way extract works for zip files in Prism."
 * It used to close on Install and leave the progress to the chip. So, as the
 * archive panel does it: the progress track is ALWAYS in the layout and only
 * fades in, because a track inserted when the work began would push the buttons
 * down and pull them back (the e2e measures that the box does not change size).
 * While the install runs the window cannot be put away by the user: Escape and
 * a press outside do nothing, and Cancel cancels the DOWNLOAD where the host
 * can (`onAbort`), which is the only honest meaning it can have then. Once the
 * installer has the file there is nothing left to cancel and the button says so
 * by being disabled. How it ended (a failure, a preview) is said on the same
 * line the progress was on, in the window the user is already looking at.
 *
 * THE NOTES ARE PLAIN TEXT, AND THAT IS A RULE, NOT A STYLE. They are a GitHub
 * release body, which is text off the network, shown in a window that can reach
 * the app's bridge to main. `parseReleaseNotes` reduces the body to strings and
 * each one is printed below as a text node, which React escapes. No markdown is
 * rendered, no HTML is set, and nothing in here is an anchor: a url in a title
 * is only characters. Do not "improve" this with a markdown renderer.
 *
 * It looks like each app's own Dialog on purpose (same scrim, same box, same
 * buttons), and sits on the OPAQUE surface token: `--p-title` and `--p-bg`
 * carry the window's alpha on an acrylic theme, and a question is not
 * something to read the desktop through.
