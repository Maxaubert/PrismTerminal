 * Everything dictation downloads, and the one thing it bundles (#13). Pure

 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: nothing is run or loaded unless its bytes
 * match a SHA-256 written down here. So every url below must name bytes that
 * CANNOT change under its checksum: a GitHub release asset by tag, and a
 * Hugging Face file by COMMIT, never `resolve/main`. A url that follows a
 * branch is a download that starts failing its checksum the day upstream
 * re-uploads, on every user's machine at once, with nothing we can ship fast
 * enough to help.
 *
 * Sizes and checksums were read from the upstream APIs on 2026-09-19 (the
 * GitHub release API's `size` and `digest`; Hugging Face's `lfs.size` and
 * `lfs.oid`), and two of them were CROSS-CHECKED against files already on the
 * owner's disk with sha256sum: ggml-base.bin and ggml-large-v3.bin both matched
 * byte for byte. The commit-pinned urls were each asked for with a HEAD request
 * and answered 200 with the same size and the same hash in `X-Linked-ETag`.

 * started, loaded Base and transcribed a clip (answering on its port 190 ms
 * after spawn). They are the zip's `Release/` folder minus the files of other
 * programs (the whisper CLI, the benchmarks, the tests, llama.dll, SDL2).
 * Since #121 the last two are parakeet-cli.exe and parakeet.dll, the same
 * zip's Parakeet runner, which needs nothing else from it (MEASURED the same
 * way: the fifteen alone transcribe a clip with Parakeet v3).
 *
 * ALL NINE `ggml-cpu-*.dll` STAY, and that is not caution. ggml picks its CPU
 * backend at run time by what the processor supports (this machine loaded
 * `ggml-cpu-cascadelake.dll`; an older one falls to haswell, sandybridge, sse42
 * or plain x64), so which one is "needed" is a fact about the USER's PC, not
 * about ours. Dropping the ones this machine did not load would ship an engine
