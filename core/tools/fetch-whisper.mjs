// electron-builder config copies to resources/bin/whisper).
//
// The engine is the OFFICIAL whisper.cpp release zip, pinned by tag and
// verified by SHA-256 (owner decision: official pinned binaries only, nothing
// we compile). The binaries are NOT committed: this is what a fresh clone and
// CI run before packaging, and re-running is free once <outDir> is populated.
//
// Plain Node, no dependencies, on purpose: it runs before `npm run build`, in
// both apps, and in a package (core-dist) that has no install step at all.
// Which is also why it cannot import core/shared/dictationCatalog.ts.
