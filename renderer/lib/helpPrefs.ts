 * on. The owner asked only that it be OPTIONAL ("optional in settings whether
 * a user wants to see them"); it is a discoverability feature for people who
 * do not yet know the shell, who are exactly the people who would never find
 * a switch to turn it on. It costs nothing while shut: no process, no
 * network, no listener beyond the one key. Off means off all the same: the
 * button goes, and the key goes back to the shell.
