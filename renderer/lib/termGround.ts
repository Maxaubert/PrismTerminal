 * lets somebody pick another background (Prism Terminal's Background colour),
 * the panel paints that instead, and a palette measured against the old one
 * can vanish on the new: the theme's light text on a light pick, its blue on a
 * blue one. So the text, the cursor and all sixteen are floored again against
 * the ground in force, each moved only as far as it must be, the rule
 * `legiblePalette` already keeps. Pure. No ground, or the theme's own: the
