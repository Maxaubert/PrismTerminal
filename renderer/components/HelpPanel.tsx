/**
 * THE COMMAND HELP POPUP (#12). Owner, 2026-09-19: "an easy to use panel where
 * you can find shell commands to use the shell more effectively... searchable...
 * metadata on each command so a natural-language search finds it", and on
 * 2026-09-20: "a pop up with copy icons for easy copying". One copy, for both
 * apps.
 *
 * IT SHOWS, AND IT COPIES ON REQUEST. NOTHING ELSE. Owner, 2026-09-19: "picking
 * a command in the help panel does NOT insert it into the shell". So this file
 * has no way to reach a shell at all: it takes no session id, imports no
 * bridge, and the one thing it can do to the outside world is hand a string to
 * `onCopy`. A person reads the command, copies it, pastes it themselves and
 * presses Enter themselves, which is the whole safety model: several of these
 * commands delete things. Do not add "Run" or "Insert" without a fresh owner
 * decision; it would be a fifth exception to "the app never types into your
 * shell", and the first one that carries Enter in spirit.
 *
 * WHAT IS COPIED IS THE EXACT TEXT ON SCREEN, placeholders and all. A command
 * with FOLDER in it fails loudly when pasted unedited, which is the right
 * failure; a panel that guessed the folder would fail quietly.
 *
 * Props only, like the update window: no bridge, no store, no host. The
 * clipboard is handed in because each host has its own way to it (and
 * `navigator.clipboard` refuses when the document has no focus). The catalogue
 * is curated text that ships with the app, so unlike the release notes there
 * is nothing here off the network; it is still printed as text nodes only.
 *
 * It sits on the OPAQUE surface token for the reason the update window does:
 * `--p-bg` carries the window's alpha on an acrylic theme, and nobody can read
 * a command through the desktop.
 */

/** How many entries are drawn at first, and how many more each time the end
 *  of the list comes into view. The catalogue is a few hundred entries with

 * just a simple, minimalist but still elegant and beautiful searchable table").
 * An entry used to be a block: a title, a sentence of summary, its command in a
 * bordered box, then a labelled box per variant and a list of placeholders. Two
 * entries filled the popup. So the entry is FLATTENED here: its own row is
 * named by its task, and each variant becomes a row of its own named by the
 * variant's label ("Copy it to the clipboard"), which is what that label always
 * was. Nothing is hidden from SEARCH by this: `searchHelp` still reads the
