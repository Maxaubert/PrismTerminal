/**
 * The update chip: a pill in the title bar, there only while there is something
 * to install. The same in both apps (#28; owner, 2026-09-19: "yes keep the
 * core"). Props only: it never reaches for a bridge, the host's `useUpdateFlow`
 * hands it everything.
 *
 * A CLICK OPENS THE WINDOW, it does not install (owner, same day: "when you
 * click the Update badge, it opens like a pop window, which shows the change
 * log or like patch notes for the new update, and then you can choose cancel
 * or install"). Until then a click on it downloaded an installer and quit the
 * app, with nothing said about what was in it.
 *
 * IT IS FILLED IN THE ACCENT (#32; owner, 2026-09-20: "have the update
 * available button be accented colour"). It was a quiet grey pill, the same
 * weight as the controls round it, and an update is the one thing in a title
 * bar that is news. The fill is `--p-sel-bg`, NOT `--p-accent`: both apps
 * derive that token as the accent moved until `--p-on-accent` clears 4.5:1 on
 * it, and this is 11.5px text. On the raw accent the floor both apps hold is
 * 3:1, which is a button's floor and not a label's.
 *
 * IT IS NO LONGER THE PROGRESS BAR. That was Prism's standing design (owner
 * pick from 12 mockups, 2026-08-24) and #28 kept it; #32 SUPERSEDES it: the
 * window stays up for the install and draws the bar itself, so a second bar
 * behind its scrim would be the same number twice. What the old design was
 * FOR still holds, and more simply: the chip never changes width, because its
 * label never changes. While an install runs it still opens the window, which
 * is how a window the host had to hide is brought back.
