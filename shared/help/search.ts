/**
 * THE HELP PANEL'S SEARCH (#12). Pure, offline and instant: no model, no
 * network, no dependency, because the panel searches on every keystroke and
 * has to work on a machine with no connection at all.
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19: "metadata on each command so a natural-language search
 * finds it ('how do I find big files', not only the command's name)". So the
 * query is read the way a person wrote it rather than matched as a substring:
 *
 *   1. the scaffolding of a question is dropped ("how do I", "the", "please"),
 *      but not the small words that carry meaning in a shell ("all", "not",
 *      "up", "out", "back", "who");
 *   2. words are folded to a stem, so "biggest files" meets "big file";
 *   3. a small synonym table covers the everyday vocabulary, so "erase a
 *      directory" meets "Delete a folder";
 *   4. a word still being typed matches by prefix, and a word of five letters
 *      or more that matches nothing at all is allowed ONE slip ("proccess"),
 *      each scored below the real thing.
 *
 * Someone who DOES know the command is served first: a query that is the
 * command's own name ("grep", "taskkill", "/compact") puts that entry on top.
 *
 * THE SCORE, highest tier first, so the order can be reasoned about:
 *   12000 / 10000  the query IS the command / its leading words
 *    6000          the same, for one of the entry's variants
 *    2000          the query is the start of the command (still being typed),
 *                  or names a later stage of its pipeline
 *    1000          EVERY meaningful word of the query matched this entry
 *    under 1000    the words themselves: per word, the best field it was found
 *                  in (task 10, keywords 6, summary 3, command 2, the rest 1),
 *                  scaled by how it matched and by how rare the word is, plus
 *                  up to 30 for a whole phrase ("where am i") found verbatim.
 * Ties break by the shorter task and then by id, so the order never depends on
 * where an entry sits in the catalogue.
