 * tail of the path with blank columns between (owner screenshot; Ctrl+L put
 * it right). So the logical line under the cursor - its wrapped rows joined
 * - is read BEFORE the resize and written back AFTER it through xterm's own
 * parser, which wraps it exactly as ConPTY's buffer does, and the cursor is
 * put back at the same character. Only when that line is the LAST thing in
 * the buffer, which is a prompt; lines below it would be moved by ConPTY
