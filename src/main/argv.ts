 * EVERY path an OS "open" or a command line passed us.

 * A FOLDER counts (2026-08-25). Explorer's Directory verb and its
 * Directory\Background verb both hand over a folder, and this used to demand
 * `isFile()`: the menu entry was there, Prism launched, and nothing happened.
 * The caller needs to know which it got, because a folder roots a tab and a
 * file opens inside one.
 *
 * ALL of them, not one (2026-08-30). This returned at the first existing path
 * walking argv BACKWARDS, so `prism a.jpg b.jpg` showed b.jpg and dropped
 * a.jpg without a word - and a command line is not a rare case now that the
 * app ships a terminal. Each path goes through the ordinary arriving-file
 * route, so the documented rule still holds: five photos from one folder is
 * one tab, not five. Capped, because argv is not a promise.

 * that exists, so walking argv opened it as a second tab called "main" beside
 * the one you asked for.
 *
 * Skipping argv[1] by POSITION is not enough, and that is the interesting
 * part: Chromium reorders its own switches, so a second instance arrives as
 * `[exe, --user-data-dir=..., --e2e, out/main/index.js, photo.jpg]` and the
 * script is at index 3. Identity is the only reliable test. (Measured: the
 * positional version passed at launch and failed on every handoff.)
