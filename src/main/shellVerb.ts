 * "Open in Prism Terminal" in File Explorer's context menu.
 *
 * Written to HKCU only - per user, no elevation, nothing machine-wide - as a
 * classic shell verb under `Directory` (any folder) and `Directory\Background`
 * (the empty space inside one). NO verb under `*`: a terminal opens folders,
 * and a row on every file's menu would be a row nobody asked for. The key name
 * is `PrismTerminal`, distinct from Prism's own `OpenWithPrism`, so the two
 * apps installed side by side never write over each other's verb.
 *
 * WINDOWS 11 CAVEAT, stated rather than papered over: the short menu that
 * appears on right-click is built from IExplorerCommand handlers, which need a
 * registered COM DLL. A classic verb like this one appears under "Show more
 * options" (Shift+F10 opens that menu directly). Every app that has not
 * shipped a shell extension DLL is in the same position.
 *
 * Registry writes go through reg.exe with arguments only - never a command
 * line - the same enumerated-exe rule the rest of Prism follows.
